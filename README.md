# ROS2 Package for ODrive Pro/S1 

This repository contains the development of a ROS2 node intended for communication with ODrive Pro/S1 devices over the CAN interface.

For information about installation, prerequisites, and getting started, checkout the official ODrive [ROS CAN Package](https://docs.odriverobotics.com/v/latest/guides/ros-package.html) Guide.

## Interface
### Nodes
#### odrive_can_node

This node is designed to interface with the ODrive Pro/S1 series of motor controllers over the CAN bus.

* subscribes to: `/control_message` ([ControlMessage](#controlmessage))

* publishes: 
    * `/odrive_status` ([ODriveStatus](#odrivestatus))
    * `/controller_status` ([ControllerStatus](#controllerstatus))

* service: `/request_axis_state` ([AxisState](#axisstate))

* parameters:

    * `node_id`: The node_id of the device this node will attach to
    * `interface`: the network interface name for the can bus

### Messages

#### ControlMessage

Exposes the minimal set of inputs to use an ODrive. 

**important** Make sure the ODrive returns to IDLE before changing the input_mode, changing this value during CLOSED_LOOP_CONTROL is not advised.

The ODrive will interpret the values of input_pos, input_vel and input_torque depending on the control mode. 

For example: In velocity control mode (2) input_pos is ignored, and input_torque is used as a feedforward term.

#### ODriveStatus

Provides ODrive/system level status updates. 
Requires setting a non-zero period for the following [cyclic messages](https://docs.odriverobotics.com/v/latest/manual/can-protocol.html#cyclic-messages)

`error_msg_rate_ms`

`temperature_msg_rate_ms`

`bus_voltage_msg_rate_ms`

**note** Each published message will wait for a new value from these endpoints. Therefore, the largest period set here will dictate the period of the ROS2 message as well.

#### ControllerStatus

Provides Controller level status updates. 
Requires setting a non-zero period for the following [cyclic messages](https://docs.odriverobotics.com/v/latest/manual/can-protocol.html#cyclic-messages)

`heartbeat_msg_rate_ms`

`encoder_msg_rate_ms`

`iq_msg_rate_ms`

`torques_msg_rate_ms`

**note** Each published message will wait for a new value from these endpoints. Therefore, the largest period set here will dictate the period of the ROS2 message as well.

### Services

#### AxisState

Sets the axes requested state. This service requires regular heartbeat messages to determine the procedure result and will block until the procedure completes, with a minimum call time of 1 second.

### Datatypes

All of the Message/Service fields are directly related to their corresponding CAN message. For more detailed information about each type, and how to interpet the data, please refer to the [ODrive CAN protocol documentation](https://docs.odriverobotics.com/v/latest/manual/can-protocol.html#messages)

## Using Python Enums

**Python Example Node coming soon!**

In the meantime, here is how you can use the [odrive python package](https://pypi.org/project/odrive/) to display the enums:

    from odrive_can.msgs import ControllerStatus # remember to include odrive_can as a package dependency
    from odrive.enums import ProcedureResult
    ... # Node setup
    ctrl_stat = ControllerStatus()
    ... # receive message data
    print(ProcedureResult(ctrl_stat.procedure_result))
